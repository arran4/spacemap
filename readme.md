# space map

Just me playing around with some algorithms for getting a stack of elements based on a Z-index at a specific location.

Possibly more to come when I have time to work on it. 

This was originally created for efficient "image mapping" for UIs and games. 

Uses an interchangable interface so you can change algorithm.
